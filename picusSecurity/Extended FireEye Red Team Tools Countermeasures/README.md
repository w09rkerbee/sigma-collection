FireEye, like all security vendors, is fighting for a good cause. And, we support FireEye. We are also doing our best to support the community. After our "[Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) Utilized by FireEye’s Red Team Tools](https://www.picussecurity.com/resource/blog/techniques-tactics-procedures-utilized-by-fireeye-red-team-tools)” article was published, we have received a significant number of demands to extend Blue Team Recommendations.  
  
In our latest blog post, "[It is Time to Take Action - How to Defend Against FireEye’s Red Team Tools](https://www.picussecurity.com/resource/blog/how-to-defend-against-fireeye-s-red-team-tools)", we detailed our Blue Team recommendations and shared our detection contents as SIGMA and vendor-specific (ArcSight, Carbon Black, QRadar, and Splunk) queries and also vendor-based (CheckPoint, Cisco, Citrix, Fortinet, F5, McAfee, ModSecurity, Palo Alto Networks, Snort, Trend Micro) prevention signatures related to defending against FireEye Red Team tools.

We shared our detection and prevention content in this repo. Read [the blog post](https://www.picussecurity.com/resource/blog/how-to-defend-against-fireeye-s-red-team-tools) to learn how you can utilize these rules and signatures to defend your systems.
